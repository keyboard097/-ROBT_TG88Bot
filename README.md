### @ROBT_TG88Bot
The `config.php` file must be set according to the instructions provided in the file itself. Please make sure to set the necessary variables, including your database connection information.

In addition to setting the config.php file, there is one more important step to take. An account must be set as the **robot admin**. To do this, you must manually add the admin account information to the `tbl_admins` table in the database. The `user_id` column in this table should be set with the numeric ID of the admin account. This will allow the admin account to have access to certain commands and features not available to regular users.

### Set Up Webhook
To receive updates from Telegram, you need to set up a webhook for your bot. This can be done using the following steps:
1. First, make sure your server has a valid SSL certificate and is accessible over HTTPS.
2. Next, obtain your bot's token from the BotFather on Telegram.
3. Determine the URL where your bot will be hosted. This should be the full URL to your `webhook.php` file, including the domain and path.

   The URL should also include the GET request parameter `token=<bot_token>` to pass the token for your bot.
   
   For example, https://example.com/mybot/webhook.php?token=1234567890:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
4. Set up the Telegram bot webhook manually by sending a request to the Telegram Bot API with the following parameters:
   ```consol
    https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/setWebhook?url=<webhook_url>&max_connections=100
    ```
    - `<bot_token>` is the token for your bot. 
    - `<webhook_url>` is the URL of your webhook.php file.
    - Set the `max_connections` parameter to 100 to ensure that the bot can handle multiple requests.
5. Once you've set up the webhook, Telegram will send all updates to your bot to the URL you provided. You can test your webhook by sending a message to your bot on Telegram.

### /forward Command
To enable the `/forward` command, you should add the following line to the `crontab`:
```
*/5 * * * * curl https://example.com/mybot/cron/forward.php >/dev/null 2>&1
```
Make sure to replace https://example.com/mybot with the actual location of the root of your bot.
